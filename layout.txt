 CSS pixels are used in CSS declarations such as width: 300px or font-size: 14px.
 the layout viewport is the area (in CSS pixels) the browser derives percentual width, such as div.sidebar {width: 20%}. Itâ€™s usually quite a bit larger than the device screen.

 using <meta name="viewport" width="device-width">, sets the width of this layout viewport to the device width in device pixel.
